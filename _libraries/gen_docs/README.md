# ToolBox API Documentation Generation

This folder contains CMake and Doxygen configuration to generate HTML API documentation for all libraries in the ToolBox project.

## Usage

1. Ensure Doxygen is installed (`brew install doxygen` on macOS).
2. From the project root, run:

   ```sh
   cd gen_docs
   cmake .
   make doc_doxygen
   ```

3. The generated HTML documentation will be in `gen_docs/html/`.

## How it works
- CMake configures Doxygen using `Doxyfile.in`.
- All headers in `include/` are scanned for API info and doc comments (including those generated by macros).
- Macros in `lib_metadata.h` embed Doxygen-style doc blocks for libraries and functions.

## Extending
- Add `LIBRARY_METADATA` and `FUNCTION_DOC` macros to new libraries/functions to include them in the docs.
